# Binary Trees
This is a repo for 0x1D C - Binary trees of the ALX SE (Holberton)

A **Binary Tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children (left and right child).

This repo covers the following concepts
1. Tree operations (insertion and deletion)
2. Checks (is leaf or is root)
3. Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, and pos-order)
4. Determining the height, depth, and size of a tree
5. Leaves and Nodes counting
6. Measuring the balance factor
7. Checking if a binary tree is full, or perfect
8. Finding the siblings, and uncle of a node
